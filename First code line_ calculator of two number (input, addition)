# My first code line
#Create a command line program to prompt the user to enter two numbers and display the sum of the two numbers.

#Case 1
a = int(input("Enter the first number : "))
b = int(input("Enter the second number : "))
sum = a + b
print(f"The result of adding {a} with {b} is equal to {sum}.")


#Case 2
a = input("Enter the first number : ")
b = input("Enter the second number : ")
sum = int(a) + int(b)
print(f"The result of adding {a} to {b} is {sum}.")


#Case 3
Q1 = input("""Do you want to calculate an addition between two numbers? 
                (use Y to answer yes and N to answer no)""")
if Q1 == "N": 
    print("The program only deals with additions between two numbers")
if Q1 == "Y": 
    a = input("Enter the first number : ")
    b = input("Enter the second number : ")
    sum = int(a) + int(b)
    print(f"The result of adding {a} with {b} is equal to {sum}.")
